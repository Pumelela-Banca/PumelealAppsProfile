        <h2>Education</h2>
        <h3>Holberton - ALX Africa (2023-2024)</h3>
        <p>I completed the Back-End Web Development Course at ALX Africa in 2024. This comprehensive 12-Momth program transformed me into a specialized back-end developer. Throughout the course, I gained proficiency in Python and JavaScript, and hands-on experience with frameworks and tools such as Django, Flask, and Node.js. I mastered database management with both SQL (e.g., MySQL) and NoSQL (e.g., MongoDB) databases, and developed the ability to build and deploy functional web applications from scratch. Additionally, I acquired a solid understanding of RESTful APIs and authentication mechanisms. The course also enhanced my communication, leadership, and problem-solving skills through ALX Foundations training. For my capstone project, I developed a fully-functional back-end web application, demonstrating my ability to create robust server-side solutions.</p>
        <h2>Matric (2011)</h2>
        <p>During my matriculation in 2011, I excelled in subjects that are foundational to computer science. I achieved an impressive 86% in Physics, demonstrating strong analytical and problem-solving skills. My 79% in Mathematics reflects my proficiency in logical reasoning and quantitative analysis, both crucial for software development. Additionally, my 79% in Life Sciences showcases my ability to understand complex systems and processes.</p>
